ðŸ“Œ Introduction

Kerala hosts a large migrant population, many of whom lack proper health records. This makes it difficult to ensure continuous healthcare, track infectious diseases, and provide equal medical access.

e-Swasthya is a digital platform that enables secure storage and easy access to migrant workersâ€™ health records. It helps healthcare providers, government agencies, and workers themselves to manage medical histories efficiently, while supporting disease prevention and public health surveillance.

Aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), e-Swasthya promotes good health and well-being, reduced inequalities, and sustainable communities, ensuring fair and inclusive healthcare access for all.
